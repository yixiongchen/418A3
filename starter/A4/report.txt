A4 report:
To run the code:
1. first run compile.sh which compile all the codes
2. execute ./RayTracer 1024 depth anti-aliasing a4.ppm
Notice: if you turn on anti-aliasing, you need enough main memory to run it.

Reason: I seperate my scene into unique anti-alising and non-antialising because combine them takes too much 
memory, my computer can not support such much memory.

There are two scenes, one has only anti-aliasing impleneted. Another has all other features implemented.


For the basic part: I think the area light source is the most difficult. It takes much time to figure
out to how to do soft shadows. Finally I found that I caluculated incorrect lambda which caused the error.
I think the most meaningful part is the scene, I use moon, earth for texture map and create a scene of universe. space. I got a lot of fun from it. The helper funtions such as matrix addition, mutiply and vector mutiplication. These functions saved me a lot of time. They are really helpful. 

For advanced part:I choose to do Texture map , draw a cylinder and glossy reflection. I found the hardest part is the texture map, it sometimes cause segmentation fault. It is very important to focus on the u, v calculation.
